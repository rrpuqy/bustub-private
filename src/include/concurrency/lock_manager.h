  /**
   * [LOCK_NOTE]
   *
   * GENERAL BEHAVIOUR:
   *    Both LockTable() and LockRow() are blocking methods; they should wait till the lock is granted and then return.
   *    If the transaction was aborted in the meantime, do not grant the lock and return false.
   *
   *
   * MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS:
   *    LockManager should maintain a queue for each resource; locks should be granted to transactions in a FIFO manner.
   *    If there are multiple compatible lock requests, all should be granted at the same time
   *    as long as FIFO is honoured.
   *
   * SUPPORTED LOCK MODES:
   *    Table locking should support all lock modes.
   *    Row locking should not support Intention locks. Attempting this should set the TransactionState as
   *    ABORTED and throw a TransactionAbortException (ATTEMPTED_INTENTION_LOCK_ON_ROW)
   *
   *
   * ISOLATION LEVEL:
   *    Depending on the ISOLATION LEVEL, a transaction should attempt to take locks:
   *    - Only if required, AND
   *    - Only if allowed
   *
   *    For instance S/IS/SIX locks are not required under READ_UNCOMMITTED, and any such attempt should set the
   *    TransactionState as ABORTED and throw a TransactionAbortException (LOCK_SHARED_ON_READ_UNCOMMITTED).
   *
   *    Similarly, X/IX locks on rows are not allowed if the the Transaction State is SHRINKING, and any such attempt
   *    should set the TransactionState as ABORTED and throw a TransactionAbortException (LOCK_ON_SHRINKING).
   *
   *    REPEATABLE_READ:
   *        The transaction is required to take all locks.
   *        All locks are allowed in the GROWING state
   *        No locks are allowed in the SHRINKING state
   *
   *    READ_COMMITTED:
   *        The transaction is required to take all locks.
   *        All locks are allowed in the GROWING state
   *        Only IS, S locks are allowed in the SHRINKING state
   *
   *    READ_UNCOMMITTED:
   *        The transaction is required to take only IX, X locks.
   *        X, IX locks are allowed in the GROWING state.
   *        S, IS, SIX locks are never allowed
   *
   *
   * MULTILEVEL LOCKING:
   *    While locking rows, Lock() should ensure that the transaction has an appropriate lock on the table which the row
   *    belongs to. For instance, if an exclusive lock is attempted on a row, the transaction must hold either
   *    X, IX, or SIX on the table. If such a lock does not exist on the table, Lock() should set the TransactionState
   *    as ABORTED and throw a TransactionAbortException (TABLE_LOCK_NOT_PRESENT)
   *
   *
   * LOCK UPGRADE:
   *    Calling Lock() on a resource that is already locked should have the following behaviour:
   *    - If requested lock mode is the same as that of the lock presently held,
   *      Lock() should return true since it already has the lock.
   *    - If requested lock mode is different, Lock() should upgrade the lock held by the transaction.
   *    - Basically there should be three steps to perform a lock upgrade in general
   *      - 1. Check the precondition of upgrade
   *      - 2. Drop the current lock, reserve the upgrade position
   *      - 3. Wait to get the new lock granted
   *
   *    A lock request being upgraded should be prioritized over other waiting lock requests on the same resource.
   *
   *    While upgrading, only the following transitions should be allowed:
   *        IS -> [S, X, IX, SIX]
   *        S -> [X, SIX]
   *        IX -> [X, SIX]
   *        SIX -> [X]
   *    Any other upgrade is considered incompatible, and such an attempt should set the TransactionState as ABORTED
   *    and throw a TransactionAbortException (INCOMPATIBLE_UPGRADE)
   *
   *    Furthermore, only one transaction should be allowed to upgrade its lock on a given resource.
   *    Multiple concurrent lock upgrades on the same resource should set the TransactionState as
   *    ABORTED and throw a TransactionAbortException (UPGRADE_CONFLICT).
   *
   *
   * BOOK KEEPING:
   *    If a lock is granted to a transaction, lock manager should update its
   *    lock sets appropriately (check transaction.h)
   *
   *    You probably want to consider which type of lock to directly apply on table
   *    when implementing executor later
   */

  /**
   * [UNLOCK_NOTE]
   *
   * GENERAL BEHAVIOUR:
   *    Both UnlockTable() and UnlockRow() should release the lock on the resource and return.
   *    Both should ensure that the transaction currently holds a lock on the resource it is attempting to unlock.
   *    If not, LockManager should set the TransactionState as ABORTED and throw
   *    a TransactionAbortException (ATTEMPTED_UNLOCK_BUT_NO_LOCK_HELD)
   *
   *    Additionally, unlocking a table should only be allowed if the transaction does not hold locks on any
   *    row on that table. If the transaction holds locks on rows of the table, Unlock should set the Transaction State
   *    as ABORTED and throw a TransactionAbortException (TABLE_UNLOCKED_BEFORE_UNLOCKING_ROWS).
   *
   *    Finally, unlocking a resource should also grant any new lock requests for the resource (if possible).
   *
   * TRANSACTION STATE UPDATE
   *    Unlock should update the transaction state appropriately (depending upon the ISOLATION LEVEL)
   *    Only unlocking S or X locks changes transaction state.
   *
   *    REPEATABLE_READ:
   *        Unlocking S/X locks should set the transaction state to SHRINKING
   *
   *    READ_COMMITTED:
   *        Unlocking X locks should set the transaction state to SHRINKING.
   *        Unlocking S locks does not affect transaction state.
   *
   *   READ_UNCOMMITTED:
   *        Unlocking X locks should set the transaction state to SHRINKING.
   *        S locks are not permitted under READ_UNCOMMITTED.
   *            The behaviour upon unlocking an S lock under this isolation level is undefined.
   *
   *
   * BOOK KEEPING:
   *    After a resource is unlocked, lock manager should update the transaction's lock sets
   *    appropriately (check transaction.h)
